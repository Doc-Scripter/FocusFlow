# FocusFlow
 Productivity tool designed to help users manage their tasks and optimize their time efficiently

 # Introduction
  This is an innovative productivity tool designed to help users manage their tasks and optimize their time efficiently. By integrating intelligent reminders with a unique feedback system, FocusFlow allows users to create, prioritize, and track their tasks seamlessly. It promotes accountability and personal growth by providing insights into user performance and suggesting routine optimizations. FocusFlow can be implemented as a Discord bot or Telegram bot, sending real-time notifications and reminders directly to users in a familiar environment, making it easier than ever to stay organized and focused on achieving goals

### Lasso Feature
In addition to traditional task management, FocusFlow introduces the revolutionary "Lasso" feature. This feature transforms the way users schedule and collaborate by allowing them to "lasso" individuals for networking, meetings, or events. Instead of booking appointments, users can send lasso requests, and when accepted by both the sender and receiver, a combined notification is triggered for all parties involved. This streamlined approach simplifies coordination and enhances collaboration, making it easier than ever to connect with others for various purposes.

# Core -Logic
  Productivity tool designed to help users manage their tasks and optimize their time efficiently

 ## Lasso Feature
  The Lasso feature in FocusFlow revolutionizes the way users schedule and collaborate with others. Instead of booking appointments, users can now "lasso" individuals for networking, meetings, or events. When a lasso request is sent and accepted by both the sender and receiver, a combined notification is triggered to all parties involved whether through an alarm,email,discord and/telegram. This streamlined approach makes it easier to coordinate schedules and collaborate effectively.

# System Requirements and Troubleshooting

## Audio Setup for WSL Users
If you're running FocusFlow on Ubuntu in Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), you might encounter the following error:

```
Error initializing speaker: failed to initialize speaker: oto: ALSA error: No such file or directory
```

This occurs because WSL doesn't have native ALSA support by default. To fix this issue, run the following commands in your WSL Ubuntu terminal:

```bash
# Update package list
sudo apt update

# Install ALSA utilities and libraries
sudo apt install -y alsa-utils libasound2 libasound2-plugins

# Install PulseAudio and its ALSA plugin
sudo apt install -y pulseaudio pulseaudio-utils
```

You may also need to create or update the ALSA configuration file:

```bash
echo 'pcm.!default {
    type pulse
    fallback "sysdefault"
    hint {
        show on
        description "Default ALSA Output (PulseAudio)"
    }
}

ctl.!default {
    type pulse
    fallback "sysdefault"
}' | sudo tee /etc/asound.conf
```

For Windows 11 users with WSL2, you can also try updating WSL:

```bash
wsl --update
wsl --shutdown
```

These steps should resolve the audio issues and allow FocusFlow's reminder system to function properly with audio notifications.
